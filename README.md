Bookmark Manager Challenge
==================

Week 4 challenge to create a web app that allows a user to save bookmarks in a database.

User Stories 
-------

```
As a web-user
So that I can save a link
I would like to add a new bookmark to the list

As a web-user
So that I can revisit a page later on
I would like to be able to see my saved bookmarks

As a web-user
So that I can organise my bookmarks
I would like to be able to tag bookmarks

As a web-user
So that I can only see bookmarks from one category
I would like to be able to view bookmarks filtered by tag

```
